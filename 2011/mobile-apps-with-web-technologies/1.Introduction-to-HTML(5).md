# Introduction to HTML(5)


## Clarification

Officially the standard is just named HTML at the HTML Working group and those HTML5 logos you see around is a common expression for the new additions in HTML, CSS3 and Javascript. At the time of this writing there is no plans at all to create HTML6, the development cycle will shift over to a module based system. where new smaller additions will be added to the main standard as the module is tested and implemented in multiple rendering engines.


## Make it easier

XHTML

	<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">

HTML4 strict

	<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">

HTML4 transitional

	<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
	
How does the browser handle the document if it is a typo in that doctype?	They just read the most basic version.

	<!doctype html>


So.. HTML5 is

	<!doctype html>


What if the browser gets served HTML that looks like this?
	
	<!doctype html>
	<title>Awesome website</title>
	<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
	<img src=picture.jpg>

It tries to display it. So... that was then valid HTML. If you are used to XHTML or HTML4 you note that the markup miss <code>&lt;head></code>, <code>&lt;body></code> and a ending <code>&lt;/p></code> element. If you look closely the <code>src</code> attribute on the image does not have any <code>"</code> surrounding the attribute declaration. It is no longer required, but I would say it is a very good practice to still keep it especially when you start adding multiple <code>classes</code> to your element.

The better to think of the following as the bare minimum required markup for a HTML document.
	
	<!doctype html>
	<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>Awesome website</title>	
	</head>
	<body>	
		<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit...</p>
		<img src="picture.jpg">
	</body>
	</html>

## What is different

There is mainly one huge difference compared to XHTML and the old version of HTML and that is the change of the semantics on text level elements. Things like <code>&lt;small></code> have a totally different use case than before and the <code>&lt;big></code> element is removed all together. Lets to through the changes and the new additions.

### Changed semantics
	
<code>&lt;a></code> - An <code>&lt;a></code> without a href attribute now represent a placehodler wehere a link otherwise mighte havebeen placed. Can now include flow content instead of being restricted to phrase content.
<code>&lt;cite></code> - This element now solely represent the title of work (a book, paper, song, script, film, etc.). In HTML4 it used to mark up the name of a person.
<code>&lt;small></code> - This element now represent small print. In HTML4 the semantic meaning was visually small.
<code>&lt;strong></code> - This element now represent importance rather than strong emphasis.
<code>&lt;hr></code> - This element now represent a paragraph-level thematic break

### Removed elements

<code>&lt;big></code>, <code>&lt;center></code>, <code>&lt;font></code> - Describing design, functionality moved to CSS

	[See the whole list](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-diff-20110405/#absent-elements) 


## New elements

### Structure elements
<code>&lt;header></code>

Represents a group of introductory or navigational aids
	
<code>&lt;nav></code>

Represent a section on the page that is intended for navigational aids

<code>&lt;section></code>

Represent a generic document or application section. Remember that you start from scratch on H1,H2, etc when you <code>&lt;section></code> your content
	
<code>&lt;article></code>
	
Represent an independent piece of content such as a blog post or an article.

<code>&lt;aside></code>
	
Represent a pice of content that is only slightly related to the rest of the page or to the section. Typical usage is "find me elsewhere" section on a portfolio or a sharing section on a blog post.
	
<code>&lt;footer></code>

Represent a footer for a section and can contain information about the author, copyright information etc. Remember that many of the "rich content" footers you see around should not be wrapped with a <code>&lt;footer></code> element. The <code>&lt;aside></code> element is a better option for those sort of things and then have the final site copyright information wrapped in a <code>&lt;footer></code>. 

### Other elements
	
<code>&lt;video></code> with the <code>&lt;source></code> element. If you want your video to play in IE<9 with javascript off you can let the browser fall back to Flash. If the user don't have flash installed you want a final fallback to a download link for the video. Example:


	<video id="movie" width="640" height="360" preload controls>
	  <source src="video.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"' />
	  <source src="video.ogv" type='video/ogg; codecs="theora, vorbis"' />
	  <source src="video.mp4" />
	  <object width="640" height="360" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"
	    data="flowplayer-3.2.1.swf"> 
	    <param name="movie" value="flowplayer-3.2.1.swf" /> 
	    <param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /> 
	    <param name="flashvars" value='config={"clip": {"url": "http://example.com/video.mp4", "autoPlay":false, "autoBuffering":true}}' /> 
	    <p>Download video as <a href="video.mp4">MP4</a>, <a href="video.webm">WebM</a>, or <a href="video.ogv">Ogg</a>.</p> 
	  </object>
	</video>
	
Note: See [Dive into HTML5 | video](http://diveintohtml5.org/video.html) for a full article on how <code>&lt;video></code> works and how you can convert all the required formats.	

	
<code>&lt;audio></code> - Same thing as with the <code>&lt;video></code> element you have to add two different formats with the <code>&lt;source></code> element. Example:

	<audio autoplay="autoplay" controls="controls">  
	    <source src="file.ogg" />  
	    <source src="file.mp3" /> 
	 		<p>Download audio as <a href="file.mp3">MP3</a> or <a href="file.ogg">Ogg</a>.</p>
	</audio>
	
<code>&lt;time></code> - This new element is one of the less talked about new addition in HTML(5).It is used for declaring the date and/or time within an HTML document. It's great for marking up publish time/date for blog posts.
	
	 <time datetime="2011-04-11T05:00+10:00">5am last Monday</time>
	
<code>&lt;canvas></code> - is used for drawing dynamic bitmap graphics on the fly, such as graphs or games. You use JavaScript to draw the content.

	<canvas width="640" height="480" id="mypainting"></canvas>
	
	<script>
		//javascript example goes here
	</script>
	
For more insight on Canvas see the <code>&lt;canvas></code> from scratch series on nettuts.
	
### "Forms 2.0"

<code>&lt;input></code> types

* tel
* search
* url
* email
* datetime
* date
* month
* week
* time
* datetime-local
* number
* range
* color

Example:

	<form>
		<label>Telephone</label>
		<input type="tel" name="telephone" />
		<input type="search" name="search" />
		<input type="url" name="url" />
		<input type="email" name="email" />
		<input type="datetime" name="datetime" />
		<input type="date" name="date" />
		<input type="month" name="month" />
		<input type="week" name="week" />
		<input type="time" name="time" />
		<input type="datetime-local" name="datetime-local" />
		<input type="number" name="number" />
		<input type="range" name="range" />
		<input type="color" name="color" />
	</form>

## HTML5 Boilerplate

In a nutshell you get a basic HTML document, CSS reset with basic element design and a few helpful Javascript libraries.

Sidenmote: Watch the videos on the website to learn more about all the benefits you get with using this as a starting point on [http://html5boilerplate.com](http://html5boilerplate.com).



## Semantically constructing a modern website (exercise)

Students are now going to write the markup for a provided design to the best of their abilities with as semantic as possible markup.

(This is homework for the next lesson as well if you can't finish).
